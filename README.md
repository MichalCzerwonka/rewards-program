## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run generate`

I prepared small script to generate some dummy data for testing purpose, feel free to play around and test it also. You
can change script settings in `mock.mjs` file. Initially app comes with `100` customers and `1000` transactions.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.


### `npm test`

Launches some unit and components tests!
